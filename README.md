# Winning Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.

In this project, I will work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out the best strategy to do well in Jeopardy:
1. Are the answers embedded into the question?
2. Are there correlations between past and current questions?

The dataset for this project comes from reddit user trexmatt which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
